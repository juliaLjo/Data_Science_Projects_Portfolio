# Data_Science_Projects_Portfolio
Data science projects completed through Yandex Practicum

### Yandex Praktikum: https://practicum.yandex.com/profile/data-scientist/
### Certificate : https://www.linkedin.com/in/jones-julia/

This repository is mainly for projects I have done under Yandex Praktikum in 2020. As part of the training, I independently completed 18 projects that were reviewed by experienced mentors. I have selected the most difficult and interesting of them so that you have the opportunity to evaluate my skills.

The Yandex Praktikum Data Science program prepares me for a career as a Data Scientist, helping me learn how to cleanse and organize data, analyze it, test hypotheses, find patterns and relationships, select features, build forecasting and classification models, choose a suitable algorithm, select hyperparameters for models, work with images, text and flat tables and etc.

## Technology stack
Programming language: Python (ver. 3)<br>
IDE: Jupyter Notebook<br>
Libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, PostgreSQL, Scikit learn, LightGBM, Catboost, Keras, PyTorch, Pymystem3, Collections<br>

*Tips: If you want to run this code localy, I would recomend you to install Anaconda and use Jupyter Notebook with it's basic libraries: Numpy , Pandas , SciPy , Scikit learn , Matplotlib , Seaborn. Libraries may vary depending on the projects. By the way, Yandex prohibits uploading source datasets and full project descriptions, so you won't see them here (non-disclosure agreement).*
